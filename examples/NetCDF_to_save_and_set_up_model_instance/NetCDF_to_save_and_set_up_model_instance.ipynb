    "# How to save an energy system model instance and set it back up? \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Xarray and NetCDF files to the rescue!** The data contained within an Energy System Model (ESM) instance is vast and complex. Saving it directly is not possible. It can, however, be saved as a NetCDF file which supports complex data structures. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### What exactly is NetCDF? \r\n",
    "NetCDF (Network Common Data Format) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. It is also a community standard for sharing scientific data. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Python modules that support working with NetCDF files:\r\n",
    "1. netcdf4-python: Official Python interface to netCDF files\r\n",
    "2. PyNIO: To access different file formats such as netCDF, HDF, and GRIB\r\n",
    "3. xarray: Based on NumPy and pandas\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Note: xarray module is used here. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For our use case, the following functionalities are provided: \r\n",
    "* Conversion of ESM instance to xarray dataset. Additionally, possible to save this dataset as NetCDF file in a desired folder, with a desired file name. \r\n",
    "* Conversion of xarray dataset/saved NetCDF file back to ESM instance.\r\n",
